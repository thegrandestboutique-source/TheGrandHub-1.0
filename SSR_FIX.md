# ✅ SSR Issue Fixed!

## What Was Wrong

The original build failed on Netlify with this error:
```
Error: useTheme must be used within ThemeProvider
```

This happened because during server-side rendering (SSR), the theme hook was being called before the theme provider was available.

## What I Fixed

### 1. Made ThemeContext SSR-Safe (`context/ThemeContext.jsx`)
- Changed `useTheme()` to return default values during SSR instead of throwing an error
- Added check for `typeof window !== 'undefined'` to avoid accessing browser APIs during build
- The provider now properly handles both server and client rendering

### 2. Updated Layout Component (`components/Layout.jsx`)
- Added a `mounted` state to only access theme after client-side hydration
- This prevents SSR mismatches

### 3. Created 500 Error Page (`pages/500.jsx`)
- Added a custom 500 error page that's SSR-compatible
- This page was being prerendered and causing the original error

## How to Deploy Now

### Option 1: Re-upload to Netlify (Easiest)

1. **Download the fixed version:**
   [Download thegrandhub.zip](computer:///mnt/user-data/outputs/thegrandhub.zip)

2. **Unzip and build:**
   ```bash
   cd thegrandhub
   npm install
   npm run build
   ```

3. **Upload to Netlify:**
   - Go to https://app.netlify.com/drop
   - Drag the `out/` folder
   - Done! ✨

### Option 2: If Using GitHub

1. **Replace your files** with the new fixed versions
2. **Commit and push:**
   ```bash
   git add .
   git commit -m "Fix SSR theme context issue"
   git push
   ```
3. **Netlify will auto-deploy** with the fix!

## Test Locally First (Recommended)

Before deploying, test that the build works:

```bash
npm install
npm run build
npm start
```

Visit http://localhost:3000 - if it works locally, it'll work on Netlify!

## What Changed (Technical Details)

### Before:
```js
export const useTheme = () => {
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
  if (!context) {
    throw new Error('useTheme must be used within ThemeProvider'); // ❌ Breaks SSR
  }
  return context;
};
```

### After:
```js
export const useTheme = () => {
  const context = useContext(ThemeContext);
  if (!context) {
    return { theme: 'dark', cycleTheme: () => {} }; // ✅ Returns defaults during SSR
  }
  return context;
};
```

The theme provider also now checks `typeof window !== 'undefined'` before accessing browser APIs like `localStorage` and `window.matchMedia`.

## Verification

After deploying, your site should:
- ✅ Build successfully on Netlify
- ✅ All pages render (home, gallery, shop, links, about)
- ✅ Theme switcher works (Dark → OLED → Light)
- ✅ Theme preference persists after reload
- ✅ No console errors
